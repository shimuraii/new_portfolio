# Gustavo's 3D portfolio :)

Welcome! I made this portfolio and I actively work on it for a while now. I love ThreeJS and I will keep trying to work on it periodically but no promises. If there is an interest feel free to contact me, I'd love to chat about this project.

# Starting this ThreeJS with Vite Starter Pack project Setup:
### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine: (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation
Once you've cloned or downloaded this project file to your local machine, navigate to this project directory in your terminal.

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

``` bash
npm install
```
### Running the project
To start the development server, run the following command:

``` bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the server and open your default browser to your localhost. The site will reload automatically as you make changes to your code.

### When deploying to vercel...

Make sure to absolutely use the command *npm run build* so that the dist file (the production file used in vercel) gets deployed.
